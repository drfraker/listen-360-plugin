A wordpress plugin to get reviews from listen 360 reviews system. Minimum requirement php5.3+. This won't work on php 5.2 or older.

Listen 360 is a service that sends out questionnaires on your behalf and collects the results in a format that is easy to track.

With this plugin you will enter your api url that you get from your profile settings page after you sign up for their service.

Install the plugin to your wordpress site, set up the plugin and enter the shortcode on any page you wish to show your reviews on.
